      <h2>1. Gather Supplies</h2>
      <p>Gather supplies including a variety of brushes, watercolor paper, range of diffrent water colors (the one shown in the picture is Kuretake Gansai Tambi 36 color set), paper towel or q-tips to blot water if desired, and a white plastic surface to mix your colors. Masking tape can be used to block off sections of your page.</p>

      <h2>2. Play</h2>
      <p>When you start, the key is to let go. Release all expectations, get in the mindset of everything goes. Mixing different colors to see what happens. Use a toothbrush to create a sprinkling effect. What happens when you throw salt onto your watercolor? Play and try things.</p>

      <h2>3. Experiment with Contraints</h2>
      <p>What are the different effects and patterns we can create using just two colors? What happens when you shorten or lengthen the time of when you overlay one color over another? Can you use the effects of a drying bush as texture? Afterwards, check out the different levels of saturation we can create using just one color.</p>

      <h2>4. Use Thumbnails for Exploration</h2>
      <p>You can use the masking tape to create thumbails for quick explorations or to determine the best layout of your composition. Start with a smaller 3x3 grid and move onto a larger 2x2 grid when you want to get into more details.</p>

      <h2>5. Pencil and absorb</h2>
      <p>Though not necessary, we can lightly use pencil to layout a particular drawing before watercoloing over it. There are also watercolor pencils for delicate details. Good old fashioned toilet paper blots or absorbs excess of watercolor very well. Q-tips can more precisely control how the water dries.</p>

      <h2>6. Express and Create</h2>
      <p>Let loose, play with color, experiment with thumbnail sizes and contraints. Blot, rewet to reveal white canvas again or apply lighter layers in the background before defining the stronger foreground. Embrace the way water moves, mixes, dries, and takes shape into whatever you create.</p>
